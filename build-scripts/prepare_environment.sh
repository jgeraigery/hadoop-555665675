# We base the expected main branch and resulting maven version for clients on the hadoop minor version
# The reason for this is hadoop re-branches for each minor release (2.4, 2.5, 2.6, etc). At each re-branch
# the histories diverge. So we'll need to create our own fork of each new minor release branch.
# The convention is a fork named "hubspot-$minorVersion", and the maven coordinates "$minorVersion-hubspot-SNAPSHOT"

# If we bump our hadoop build version, we should bump this as well
# At some point it would be good to more closely link this to our hadoop build, but that can only happen
# once we update our apache-hadoop build to do a full maven. At which point we can probably change this to
# like 3.0-hubspot-SNAPSHOT and leave it at that.
